there are 5 files inside this Github : 3 .py files and 2 dataset file. 
there are 2 .py files that need to upload images from the data set. 
The dataset is divided into two files : 
"ground", which are the dataset of the pre-analyzed moon ground images, and has to be used for the "moon_ground_model_pathfinding.py" file 
"render", which are the base moon ground images, that need to be uploaded for the "moon_ground_model.py" file
The "Grid_model_code.py" is runnable with uploading any file
for the .py files that need the dataset, on the first lines of the program there will be a variable named "IMAGE_DIR",
you just need to change the directory (which would be named "directory"), and the code should run without any problem
Caution : Because of the size limit of GitHub, the dataset are smaller than the original, but it shouldn't ba problem
